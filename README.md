# Snake-2.0
A replication and improvement to the snake game created for my personal project over Summer of 2019. This project will be utilizing JavaFX instead of SWING. I plan to improve the movement of the snake, so that it would follow certain grids instead of free-roaming, and add a pre game interface that is more friendly for the user (where they can select their difficulty).
